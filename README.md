# Embankment-and-Tunnel
Using PLAXIS 2D, designed a road embankment and calculated the total displacement, the difference in pore water dissipation times before and after introducing vertical drains and the safety factor after the end of the construction phase. Also, determined the total settlement of a building due to a tunnel construction, calculated axial and shear forces, bending moments and principal stresses of the tunnel.
